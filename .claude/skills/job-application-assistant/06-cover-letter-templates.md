# Cover Letter Templates and Tailoring Guide

<!-- BEGIN ACTIVE-TEMPLATE (managed by /add-template - do not edit by hand) -->
> **Active template override: `cover-cls-tectonic`**
>
> A custom template is active. Where this block conflicts with the stock guidance below, this block wins. Structural advice below (tailoring, page-budget, cutting rules) still applies.
>
> - **Template skeleton:** `cover_letters/cover_example.tex` — the stock cover.cls letter; only the toolchain differs
> - **Manifest:** none — the stock guidance below is the style guide
> - **Source extension:** `.tex`
> - **Compile command:** `rm -f <file>.pdf && mkdir -p build && tectonic -X compile --outdir build <file>.tex && mv build/<file>.pdf ./` (not the `xelatex` command named in the stock guidance below — this machine has tectonic, a XeTeX engine, instead of a TeX distribution). Run it from the output directory. If it redirects to `build/`, the log is in `build/`, and `/apply`'s Step 5e cleanup must delete that `build/` folder too
> - **Fonts:** Lato/Raleway from `cover_letters/OpenFonts/fonts/` (bundled; `\fontspec` paths are relative to `cover_letters/`)
> - **Page limit:** exactly 1 page(s)
> - **Output file:** `cover_letters/cover_<company>_<role>.tex`; `cover.cls` and `OpenFonts/` are already in that directory
> - **When:** only when the posting requires or invites a cover letter (US default is resume only). US conventions: English, Letter paper, "Dear Hiring Manager" when no name is given, closing "Best regards,". Never state or imply US citizenship or permanent residency; when the posting raises work authorization, say plainly "I am on F-1 STEM OPT and will require H-1B sponsorship".

## Template: Custom cover.cls (XeLaTeX)

Cover letters use a custom LaTeX document class (`cover.cls`) with Lato/Raleway fonts.

**Output file:** `cover_letters/cover_<company>_<role>.tex`
**Compile with:** XeLaTeX (cover.cls requires fontspec)
**Font directory:** `cover_letters/OpenFonts/fonts/`

### Compile command

```bash
cd cover_letters && xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode cover_<company>_<role>.tex
```

Expected output: `Output written on cover_<company>_<role>.pdf (1 page, ...)`. Any page count other than 1 is a failure that must be fixed before presenting to the user.

## Compile-and-Inspect Loop (MANDATORY)

After writing the cover letter and before presenting to the user, always compile and visually inspect the PDF. Iterate until the layout is clean:

1. Run `xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode cover_<company>_<role>.tex`
2. Confirm page count is exactly 1 and compile succeeded
3. Read the PDF via the Read tool and visually check: signature fits at the bottom, no text cut off, bullet font matches body

### Known template pitfall: itemize inside `\lettercontent{}`

The `\lettercontent{}` macro appends `\\` to its argument. This breaks when the argument ends in `\end{itemize}` because `\\` has no line to break after the environment closes, producing `! LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end.` and no PDF output.

**Wrong (breaks compile):**
```latex
\lettercontent{Here is how my experience maps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ...
\end{itemize}}
```

**Correct — close `\lettercontent{}` before the list and wrap the list in the matching Raleway-Medium font so typography stays consistent:**
```latex
\lettercontent{Here is how my experience maps:}

{\raggedright\fontspec[Path = OpenFonts/fonts/raleway/]{Raleway-Medium}\fontsize{11pt}{13pt}\selectfont
\begin{itemize}
    \item ...
\end{itemize}\par}
\vspace{6pt}

\lettercontent{[next paragraph]}
```

The font wrapper is mandatory — if you just move `\begin{itemize}` outside `\lettercontent{}` without the `\fontspec` block, bullets render in the default body font (Lato) and visually mismatch the rest of the letter.

\lettercontent{[Personal fit paragraph - behavioral strengths, team contribution, 2-3 sentences]}

\lettercontent{I look forward to hearing from you.}

\begin{flushright}
% No trailing \\ inside \closing{} - cover.cls appends its own \\, and a

\closing{Best regards,}

## Key Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `\namesection{}{Name}{contact info}` | Header with name and contact |
| `\currentdate{date}` | Date field (use `\today` or explicit date) |
| `\lettercontent{text}` | Body paragraph (adds spacing after) |
| `\closing{text}` | Closing line |
| `\signature{name}` | Printed name below signature |

## Tailoring Guidelines

### Salutation
- If you know the hiring manager's name: "Dear [First Last],"
- If you know the team: "Dear [Company] hiring team,"
- Generic: "Dear [Company]," (avoid "To whom it may concern")

### Length - Hard 1-Page Limit
- Target: 1 page including signature block
- Maximum: **never exceed 1 page**
- **Word budget: 250-300 words** of body text (not counting LaTeX markup). This is the safe maximum. 350 words will overflow.
- **Always count**: opening paragraph + bullet list paragraph + closing paragraph = 3 blocks. Add a 4th only if the others are short.
- When adding company-specific content, trim other content to compensate rather than adding net length

### Line Spacing
- Add `\usepackage{setspace}` and `\setstretch{1.0}` if the letter is long and needs to fit on one page
- Use `\vspace{.5cm}` between major sections for readability (only if space permits)

### Bullet Lists
- Place `\begin{itemize}...\end{itemize}` **outside** a `\lettercontent{}` block (see "Known template pitfall" above), wrapped in the matching Raleway-Medium `\fontspec` so the bullet font matches the body
- 3-5 bullets is ideal
- Start each bullet with bold label or action verb
- Use `\textbf{Label:}` for category-style bullets
- A bullet whose text begins with a literal `[` must be braced: `\item {[text]}`. Unbraced, LaTeX parses `[text]` as `\item`'s optional label and renders it off the left page edge, missing from the PDF text layer entirely

### LaTeX Special Characters
Escape these wherever they appear in body text:
- Ampersand: `\&` (company names: Brüel \& Kjær, H\&M) - unescaped, the compile fails loudly
- Percent: `\%` ("grew revenue 30\%") - unescaped, it does **not** fail: everything after the `%` on that line is silently eaten as a LaTeX comment
- Dollar: `\$`, hash: `\#`, underscore: `\_`
- Tilde: `\textasciitilde{}`, caret: `\textasciicircum{}`, backslash: `\textbackslash{}`

### Non-English Cover Letters
- Same template structure, just write content in the posting's language
- Adjust date format to local convention
- Adjust closing to local convention (e.g. "Med venlig hilsen," for Danish)

## Checklist Before Finalizing
- [ ] No em-dashes (use commas or periods instead)
- [ ] No cliches or empty filler
- [ ] Every claim backed by specific example

- [ ] Company name and role are correct throughout
- [ ] Date is current
- [ ] Fits on one page
- [ ] Language matches the job posting language
- [ ] Salutation is appropriate (named person if possible)
- [ ] Headline is engaging and specific, not generic

## Submission Guidelines (Best Practice)
- Submit only the documents the employer requests
- Export as PDF to preserve formatting
- Name files clearly: "[Your Name] CV" and "[Your Name] Cover Letter"
- Follow all employer instructions regarding anonymity or specific materials
